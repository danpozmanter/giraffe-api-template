#### Examples:

Default Giraffe web application with the `GiraffeViewEngine` and no tests:

```
dotnet new giraffe
```

Default Giraffe web application with the `GiraffeViewEngine` and a default test project:

dotnet new giraffe --IncludeTests
```

Giraffe web application with the Razor view engine and a default test project:

dotnet new giraffe --ViewEngine razor --IncludeTests
```

## 0.10.0

#### New features

The Giraffe template supports three different view engines now:

- `razor`
- `dotliquid`

You can optionally specify the `--ViewEngine` (or short `-V`) parameter and select one of the supported options when creating a new Giraffe project:

```
dotnet new giraffe --ViewEngine razor
```

When you run `dotnet new giraffe` it will automatically create a new Giraffe project with the default `GiraffeViewEngine` engine.
